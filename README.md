# predict-prices-uniplaces

**Web Scrapping** (1-scraping.ipynb)

Using Selenium, I scrapped information from the first 20 pages of private room listings in Lisbon from the platform Uniplaces. 

**Data preparation and cleaning** (2-cleaning.ipynb)

I cleaned the data using Pandas.

**Price prediction** (3-prediction.ipynb)

I used the data to predict the price of some of the listings scraped. 
I used Sklearn to preprocess data, apply different models and choose the best model, based on RMSLE.

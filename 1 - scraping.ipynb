    "We want to extract data regarding listings of private rooms in Lisbon from Uniplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniplaces uses Javascript, meaning that approaches using BeautifulSoup do not work. \n",
    "We will use Selenimium to scrape the data of the first 20 pages of listings."

    "## Conclusions \n",
    "(also at the end)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was my first proper experience using Selenium. I think I learned the basics and maybe a little more, as Uniplaces heavily relies on javacript and even on cases where I could avoided it and use something like BeautifulSoup or string functions, I made an effort of using Selenium. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to consistently extract all the data from the listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, there are a some of things that I would have done different:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn about WebDriverWait:** When I started I was not aware of the WebDriverWait function and its need. As a result, my code looks a bit \"sewn\" together. If I knew, I would have created generic functions before.\n",
    "2. **Learn about location and expections:** The same thing goes for location functions, which I found are only needed for some listings, and expections, particularly expected conditions.\n",
    "3. **Do generic functions sooner:** The cards of the listings are not that different. I would have created more generic functions. \n",
    "4. **Scrape random listings:** I noticed that the scrapping could lead to a high amount of variables and used some techniques to reduced. However, I was not very efficient, as I was not aware of for example, how some variables may have \"No photos\" substring. I could have scrapped random listings first to identify possible problems like this. Still, it is easier and faster to clean the dataframe than scrape the data again.\n",
    "5. **Learn to bypass request limits:** Fortunately, Uniplaces does not seem to limit the amount of requests made. If I do this again, I will look into how to bypass such limits (while not doing anything illegal).\n",
    "6. **Prepare for listings removed:** I would have prepare in case the listing was removed (this only happened once in all 20 pages). \n",
    "7. **Include name of card in key:** For example, \"student\" can be regarding the tenant or the landlord, and I did not account for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extraction of almost all the data from the listings led to a very complete, perhaps too complete, dataset. This is not uncommon, given that I did not have a problem/question in mind while acquiring data. As such, I scraped as much data as possible, which led to an overcomplicated dataset. \n",
    "But that is okay, case I get to show that I can clean a dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook was a success."

    "## Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "This was my first proper experience using Selenium. I think I learned the basics and maybe a little more, as Uniplaces heavily relies on javacript and even on cases where I could avoided it and use something like BeautifulSoup or string functions, I made an effort of using Selenium. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to consistently extract all the data from the listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, there are a some of things that I would have done different:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn about WebDriverWait:** When I started I was not aware of the WebDriverWait function and its need. As a result, my code looks a bit \"sewn\" together. If I knew, I would have created generic functions before.\n",
    "2. **Learn about location and expections:** The same thing goes for location functions, which I found are only needed for some listings, and expections, particularly expected conditions.\n",
    "3. **Do generic functions sooner:** The cards of the listings are not that different. I would have created more generic functions. \n",
    "4. **Scrape random listings:** I noticed that the scrapping could lead to a high amount of variables and used some techniques to reduced. However, I was not very efficient, as I was not aware of for example, how some variables may have \"No photos\" substring. I could have scrapped random listings first to identify possible problems like this. Still, it is easier and faster to clean the dataframe than scrape the data again.\n",
    "5. **Learn to bypass request limits:** Fortunately, Uniplaces does not seem to limit the amount of requests made. If I do this again, I will look into how to bypass such limits (while not doing anything illegal).\n",
    "6. **Prepare for listings removed:** I would have prepare in case the listing was removed (this only happened once in all 20 pages). \n",
    "7. **Include name of card in key:** For example, \"student\" can be regarding the tenant or the landlord, and I did not account for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extraction of almost all the data from the listings led to a very complete, perhaps too complete, dataset. This is not uncommon, given that I did not have a problem/question in mind while acquiring data. As such, I scraped as much data as possible, which led to an overcomplicated dataset. \n",
    "But that is okay, case I get to show that I can clean a dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook was a success."
